# DateTime Library: A Header-only Solution for Date and Time in C++

DateTime is an easy to use, header only library for handling Date and Time. 

It consists of three main components: DateTime class, TimePoint struct and TimeSpan struct.

Days start from Monday, providing a deviation from the standard Sunday start used in std::chrono.

The code is written targeting a balance between ease of use and performance.
