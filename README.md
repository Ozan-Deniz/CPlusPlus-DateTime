# CPlusPlus-DateTime

DateTime is an easy to use, header only library. 

It has 3 main component. DateTime class, TimePoint and TimeSpan.

Days start from Monday, instead of Sunday which is what std::chrono starts the week with.

The code is written targeting a balance between ease of use and performance.
